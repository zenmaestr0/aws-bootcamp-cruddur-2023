# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## Required Homework

### Verify AWS CLI installed and available

I have already installed AWS CLI for Windows 10 on my PC last summer.

The screenshot below shows the output of ```aws configure``` and ```aws sts get-caller-identity``` commands.

### Recreate Conceptual Diagram in Lucidchart 

I have created a free account in Lucidchart and created the diagram below. It was pretty straightforward with the given example.

### Recreate Logical Architectual Diagram in Lucidchart 

For the logical architecture I added AWS shapes library and followed the video instructions to discover the interface. I found Lucidchart quite a practical tool to generate complex diagrams.

I was able to create both diagrams without starting a free trial.

### Create a Budget and Billing Alarm

I created my low budget of 1$.

I have created a billing alarm and budget only via AWS console, which I was somehow familiar with.

For a future reference, I added the template file in the repo ![json file](https://github.com/zenmaestr0/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/main/aws/json/alarm_config.json) so that I can create an alarm via AWS CLI.
